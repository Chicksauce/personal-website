      <p>
        I’m Jill Ji. I write and create around slow mornings, intentional
        choices, and the quiet confidence that comes from knowing what matters
        most. This space is where I collect reflections on style, ritual, and
        everyday beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not working on a new idea, you’ll find me resetting my space,
        exploring cafés, curating playlists, or walking without a destination.
