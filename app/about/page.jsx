        I’m Jill. I’m drawn to beauty that feels lived-in, conversations that go
        somewhere, and systems that make life gentler instead of louder.

        I’ve built a stable, outwardly successful life—but what matters more to
        me is how it feels day to day. I care about consistency, emotional
        presence, and designing a life that can hold both intensity and rest.

        This site isn’t a portfolio. It’s a record of attention—what I’m
        learning, refining, and choosing to stay with.
